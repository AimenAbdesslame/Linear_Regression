#Linear Regression from Scratch
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project implements Linear Regression from scratch in Python using only NumPy and Matplotlib.
The goal is to improve my numerical programming skills in Python and gain a deeper understanding of core AI/ML concepts such as:

Loss function (Mean Squared Error)

Gradient Descent optimization

Linear Regression model training

Data visualization with Matplotlib

Instead of relying on libraries like scikit-learn, I coded the algorithm step by step to fully understand how Linear Regression works under the hood.



ðŸš€ Features

Reads dataset: Study Hours vs Exam Scores

Implements:

Loss function

Gradient Descent algorithm

Trains a linear model (y = mx + b)

Visualizes results with scatter plot + regression line



ðŸ–¼ Example Output

The model learns the relationship between study hours and exam scores:

ðŸ”´ Red = data points

ðŸ”µ Blue = best-fit regression line



ðŸ“‚ Tech Stack

Python 3

Pandas (data handling)

NumPy (math operations)

Matplotlib (visualization)



ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes

Improved numerical programming skills in Python

Hands-on understanding of gradient descent & optimization

Stronger foundation in AI/ML concepts for future projects



ðŸ“Œ How to Run
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-name>
pip install -r requirements.txt (you need : python3 , pandas , numpy , matplotlib)
python linear_regression.py
